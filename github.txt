Problem 1.1
1. The pwd command will show you where you are in the directory, and in which subfolder.
2. ls - patterns.txt and symmetry.py will show up when we input ls
3. Nano patterns.txt will open the text file and allow you to edit it
4. The cat command will let you view the file by dipslaying the content in the terminal - cat patterns.txt
5. diff patterns.txt symmetry.txt will show us the differences in the lines between the 2 files
6. Assuming already in music: mv patterns.txt ~/math/calculus/
7. rm ~/math/geometry/triangle.txt
8. Cd ../math
9. Git init while inside the directory 
10. Git remote add origin with the ssh url from the repo
11. cp ~/music/symmetry.txt ~/math/
12. The command would be git status, and the file is not tracked as we have not git added it


13. Only file - git add symmetry.txt
All files - git add .
14. Yes, now if we do git status its currently being tracked. git restore --staged symmetry.txt will unstage the file but not remove it
15. Git commit -m “Whatever message you want to put about what is being committed”
16. Git push origin main, we are going to push to main because that is what were working on 
17. Git branch applied_math
18. Git checkout applied_math
19. Git add . -> git commit -m “message” -> git push origin applied_math; if we moved back without committing the changes it would not save them
20. Git branch, the highlighted in green branch is the one were currently working in 
21. Git checkout main (or name of original branch)
22. Can use the git merge command
23. Screenshot.
