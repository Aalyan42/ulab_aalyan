# 1. For 2.1, outputting all the values added together instead of in a list. Was using the '+' operater wrong like there were other strings to add when there weren't. Fixed by changing to brackets, adding commas, and removing plus signs.
# 2. Syntax error (issue with the written code) forgot to add ':' after defining a function. Fixed by adding a colon.

# 3. NameError: name 'true' is not defined. Was registering 'true' as a string, but the 'True' operater has a captial T. had to change. A name error is usually a typing error.

    rmnder = x % y

# function is taking in variables x and y, doing a bunch of arithmetic operations, and returning all the results in a list.

#printing output of function after calling it, and setting a and b to necessary variables

# Your thinking process and description here
# My function name was unique, not just function. My variable names describe the operation they were completing.
# There was proper spacing between the variables and functions, and the comments described what was happening






# Your code here

def arithmetic_function (x):
    x +=5
    x *= 3
    return x

x = 10
print (arithmetic_function(x))

x = 5
print (arithmetic_function(x))






# Your thinking process and response here
# I thought that instead of assigning new variables like increment_by_5 = x + 5,
# I can just take the x variable and manipulate it, and then output it when done.
# That way the whole function looks cleaner and runs smoother

# Initially, had another if function defining what to do if x was out of the range. Then realized that can just apply an else function as if x is not in the range by logic it is outside of it, and I can return false. The function is simple and efficient.
